This is a slightly patched version of MongoDB 2.4.14. The only real difference
at the moment would be a slightly raised maximum file limit for the storage
engine from 16,000 files to 18,000 files. This raises the maximum database size
from around 32TB to roughly 36TB.

To build your own, you can run `./build-docker.sh`.
